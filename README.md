# Installation
- Unzip and paste the AfterEffects folder (contains integration, presets, scripts, userinterfaces) in the location you want the plugin to be.
- Run Prism as administrator.
- Go to settings > Plugins and in the top-right corner there is a cogwheel icon that reads Manage plugins paths...
- in plugins paths press the + button and add the fusion folder, the new path must read something like C:\ProgramData\Prism2\Plugins\AfterEffects.
- Another way is to add the parent folder to Plugin search paths and let prism look for the plugin.
- Press ok and restart prism as non admin.
- Go to settings DCC apps > AfterEffects tab and press the button that reads "add", press ok in the default location and that's it.
